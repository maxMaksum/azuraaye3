# 🔍 Step 3 Verification Guide

## ✅ **What I Fixed:**

### **Problem:** Step 3 was not showing up on screen

### **Root Cause:** Layout issue with Column vs LazyColumn
- The content was too long for a regular Column
- Step 3 was getting cut off at the bottom
- No scrolling capability

### **Solution Applied:**
1. **Changed Column to LazyColumn** for proper scrolling
2. **Wrapped each section in `item {}`** blocks
3. **Ensured Step 3 is always visible** regardless of file selection

## 📱 **How to Verify Step 3 is Working:**

### **Test 1: Initial Load**
1. Open Bulk Registration screen
2. **Should see ALL 3 steps immediately:**
   - ✅ Step 1: Download Template (Blue card)
   - ✅ Step 2: Select File (Gray card)  
   - ✅ Step 3: Upload & Import (Gray card, disabled)

### **Test 2: File Selection**
1. Click "Browse Files" in Step 2
2. Select any file
3. **Step 3 should activate:**
   - Changes from gray to green
   - Button text changes from "Select File First" to "Import Student Data"
   - Button becomes enabled

### **Test 3: Scrolling**
1. Scroll down the screen
2. **Should be able to see all content:**
   - All 3 steps visible
   - Import results (when available)
   - Student preview (when available)

## 🎯 **Expected Visual States:**

### **Step 3 - Disabled State (No file selected):**
```
🔘 GRAY CARD (surfaceVariant background)
⬆️ Gray Upload Icon + "Step 3: Upload & Import"
💬 "Select a file first to enable upload"
🔘 [Select File First] Button (disabled, grayed out)
```

### **Step 3 - Active State (File selected):**
```
🟢 GREEN CARD (tertiaryContainer background)
⬆️ Green Upload Icon + "Step 3: Upload & Import"  
💬 "Ready to import your student data"
🔘 [Import Student Data] Button (enabled, blue)
```

### **Step 3 - Loading State:**
```
🟢 GREEN CARD
⏳ Spinner + "Importing..."
```

## 🚀 **If Step 3 Still Not Visible:**

1. **Check screen size** - Try scrolling down
2. **Check device orientation** - Try portrait/landscape
3. **Check for compilation errors** - Look for any build issues
4. **Restart app** - Fresh launch to clear any state issues

## ✅ **Verification Checklist:**

- [ ] Step 1 visible on screen load
- [ ] Step 2 visible on screen load  
- [ ] **Step 3 visible on screen load (most important!)**
- [ ] Step 3 starts in disabled/gray state
- [ ] Step 3 activates when file is selected
- [ ] All steps remain visible during scrolling
- [ ] Upload button works when enabled

The Step 3 should now be **always visible** from the moment you enter the bulk registration screen!
